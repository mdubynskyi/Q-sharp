Problem: Algorithm HHL

// Inputs:
// A: Hermitian matrix representing the linear system Ax = b
// b: Vector representing the right-hand side of the equation
// epsilon: Precision of the solution

// Promise:
// x: Solution vector to Ax = b

1. Prepare Quantum Environment:
    Initialize quantum register Q to state |0>
    Initialize ancilla qubit a to state |0>

2. State Preparation:
    Prepare the quantum state |b> in register Q corresponding to vector b

3. Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE):
    Apply QPE with unitary operation U = exp(iAt) on Q, using ancilla qubits
    This encodes eigenvalues of A into the phases of the ancilla qubits

4. Controlled Rotation:
    For each eigenvalue lambda encoded in ancilla qubits:
        Apply controlled rotation on ancilla qubit a with angle proportional to 1/lambda
    End For

5. Inverse Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE):
    Apply IQPE to uncompute the eigenvalues, leaving the system in state close to |x>

6. Ancilla Measurement:
    Measure ancilla qubit a
    If a = |1>, the system in Q is now in a state proportional to |x>, the solution
    Else, restart the algorithm
